# 1. What is k Means Clustering?
**k means clustering** divides arbitrary data into groups
based on their similarity (or distance) into ***k*** clusters.
The algorithm is effective at grouping unclustered data
without any difficulty, but the result is not uniform (randomness)
and it may require some time.

However, the result will be acceptable if the data is well-categorized
and the algorithm is easy to understand and implement.
